# enchante
Simplify your DB management

## Motivation

Imagine you're creating an API that connects to your SQL DB via SQLAlchemy. One of the biggest pain points is to create a structure that makes logical sense along with being easy to scale (as in add more tables easily).
Well, that's where `enchante` comes in!

This CLI helps with creating and scaffolding the structure of your db architecture as python code.
